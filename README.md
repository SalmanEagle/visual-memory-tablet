VMT Notation is a shorthand method of referencing memories stored in one's brain.

Buddha posited the theorem of Suffering for his disciples. As for the tradition I follow, there is a saying in it that there is one organ in the body, that if it is ailing - the entire body suffers, and if it is strong the entire body is healed. This organ is the Heart; or as I understood now: the organ for "meta learning".

In the quest for learning at warp speed, to solve Earth's intractable problems, I used a little known Mathematics principle to develop a shorthand method of referencing memories stored in the brain. The Visual Memory Tablet notation enhances speed of recall. I have developed a computer program to translate English words into this logical notation.

This Mathematics rule is as follows: if you add the digits of ANY number, no matter how large; they resolve to the digits 1 to 9.

For example: the number 583. If you add the digits: 5 + 8 + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16 = 1 + 6 = 7.

The applications of this principle are countless. One meaning is that, for example, an organization with many employees can be managed by just 9 executives.

However, it took me 10 years since learning this Mathematics principle to develop the notation I am going to explain as follows:

ALPHABET NUMERICAL EQUIVALENCE: Letters of the English alphabet can be represented by the numbers 1 to 26. 
LOCALIZATION: Now, we can use a group of entities - such as the NATO Alphabet for example, to represent the digits 1 to 9: 

A. Alfa: 1
B. Bravo: 2
C. Charlie: 3
D. Delta: 4
E. Echo: 5
F. Foxtrot: 6
G. Golf: 7
H. Hotel: 8
I. India: 9 

RECURRENCE: Since digits/letters will be reused, we represent the recurrence by 1 OR 2. Or lets localize this too, to {UN} OR {UN}{UN} respectively. 
NOTATION: Each word can be represented by its First Letter and Length. 
VARIABLES: First letters that are non-alphanumeric are represented by "Pakistan" (PK). 
RESOLUTION: Finally, we apply the mentioned Mathematics principle and instead of needing 26 Letters, we just need 9 Letters (represented by their Locale) repeatedly. 

A. Alfa: 1
B. Bravo: 2
C. Charlie: 3
D. Delta: 4
E. Echo: 5
F. Foxtrot: 6
G. Golf: 7
H. Hotel: 8
I. India: 9
J. {TO} Alfa: 10
K. {TO} Bravo: 11
L. {TO} Charlie: 12
M. {TO} Delta: 13
N. {TO} Echo: 14
O. {TO} Foxtrot: 15
P. {TO} Golf: 16
Q. {TO} Hotel: 17
R. {TO} India: 18
S. {TO}{TO} Alfa: 19
T. {TO}{TO} Bravo: 20
U. {TO}{TO} Charlie: 21
V. {TO}{TO} Delta: 22
W. {TO}{TO} Echo: 23
X. {TO}{TO} Foxtrot: 24
Y. {TO}{TO} Golf: 25
Z. {TO}{TO} Hotel: 26.

Here is a sample: the word "apple" is "AL +5".

The word "joint" is: "{TO}  AL +5".

"Saver" would be "{TO}{TO}  AL +5".

The word "Platinum" in VMT Notation will be: "{TO} GO +8". That is because "Plat

inum" has 8 letters and begins with the 16th letter, which is subordinate to the (1+6) 7th Letter: Golf.

Finally, "!hurry" would be rendered as: "PK +6".

The advantage of this system is that you are always using, basically, just 9 symbols (countries) to represent any Word. Further, at a more advanced level you could represent a whole sentence in the same way OR a whole chapter or book or even physical buildings. This is potentially, the basis for Photographic Memory.

In database indexing, it is known that if you divide a random set of cards into suits; then looking for a particular card becomes quite a few times faster (the number of flips needed becomes lesser). In our VMT Notation, we have taken 26 disparate elements and created 9 groups, hence increasing the speed with which memories stored in the brain can be indexed.

For generations, chanting mantras has been used to exercise this meta learning skill. The method of chanting is to use the Indices (such as "Alfa +5") to recollect Words one is chanting. One can also use songs she listens to, in order to practice indexing the lyrics.
