<i><h2>EXAMPLE:</h2></i>
In VM NOTATION, the word "Skin" would be "{2}A +4". In this word, the first letter ("S") is mathematically just a second Recurrence of A, so represented as "{2}A"; and since the string has 4 lettrs, we put +4.

<i><h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2></i>
Visual Memory NOTATION (VMN) is a shorthand method of referencing memories stored in the brain. It can increase speed of recall.

Buddha posited the theorem of Suffering for his disciples. As for the tradition I follow, there is a saying in it that there is one organ in the body, that if it is ailing - the entire body suffers, and if it is strong the entire body is healed. This organ is the Heart; or as I understood now: the organ for "meta learning".

To enable learning at warp speed and solve Earth's intractable problems, I used a little known Mathematics principle to develop a shorthand method of referencing memories stored in the brain. The VM NOTATION enhances speed of recall. I have developed an Excel macro to translate English words into this logical notation.

<b>This Mathematics rule is as follows: if you add the digits of ANY number, no matter how large; they resolve to the digits 1 to 9.

For example: the number 583. If you add the digits: 5 + 8 + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16 = 1 + 6 = 7.</b>

<i><h2>PROCESS:</h2></i>

<i>

1. ALPHABET NUMERICAL EQUIVALENCE: Letters of the English alphabet can be represented by the numbers 1 to 26.

2. RECURRENCE: Now, instead of needing 26 Letters - we just need 9 Letters. We represent recurrences by 1 OR 2. For example, J is letter 10 ~ which resolves to 1. Therefore, J is a Recurrence of A and can simply be represented as {1}A. A, itself, would be {0}A.

3. NOTATION: Each word can be represented by its First Letter and Length.Â The word "joint" is: "{1}A +5".

4. VARIABLES: First letters that are non-alphanumeric are represented by Pipe (|).</i>

The advantage of this system is that you are always using, basically, just 9 Symbols to represent any Word. Further, at a more advanced level you could represent a whole sentence in the same way OR a whole chapter or book or even physical buildings. This can potentially enable <b>Photographic (Visual) Memory</b>. The probable method of achieving this is to apply the Separator (/), and grouping strings based on their Lengths (Pantheons).

<b>In database indexing, it is known that if you divide a random set of cards into suits; then looking for a particular card becomes quite a few times faster (the number of flips needed becomes less).</b> In our VM NOTATION, we have taken 26 disparate elements and divided them into 9 pre-existent groups, hence increasing the speed with which memories stored in the brain can be indexed.

The Separator, /, further enables <b>endless</b> grouping. Forming distinct groups is the job of the Brain.
